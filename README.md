# LeetCode - Java

Just a personal repository that stores my Java code for LeetCode practices :) 

The package `quickpractices` only contains one version of answer for each question, 
while the package `casestudies` contains multiple answers from me and quick analysis
of performance differences. Do notice: the analysis is only there
to improve my own coding ability and does not always contain the most efficient answers.
